## Week 1 - Depth in Rust 
I explored the rust concepts in depth specially the `traits` , `macros`  , `struct` and `impl`. Traits are a way to define a set of behaviors that a type can have. 

### What I Learned
- Traits
- Macros
- Structs
- Impl

### What I Did
- Created a simple `struct` and `impl` it for a `trait`
- Write a struct and trait for converting from struct to bytess and vice versa similar to `serialize` and `deserialize` in `serde`
